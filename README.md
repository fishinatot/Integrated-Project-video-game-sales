# Integrated-Project-video-game-sales

this is one of the projects i'm most proud of. i like video games and i felt i could express a part of myself in this.

the files inside are the jupyter notebook which is a projects that integrates preprocessing, EDA and statistical data analysis into one project.

also added the games.csv file which is the dataset i worked with.
